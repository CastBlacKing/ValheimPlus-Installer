# Como Usar
If your game is not in the default folder (C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/valheim), you will need to know where it was installed, when you find out, copy the directory by clicking on an empty space in the address bar, and when prompted paste it into CMD using the right mouse button.

1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/Valheim-Brasil/InstaladorVPlus/releases), download the latest version of the installer and run it.
2. Your antivirus or your browser may accuse the program as harmful to your computer, but this is because I don't put a license on the program, so Windows detects it as unlicensed.
